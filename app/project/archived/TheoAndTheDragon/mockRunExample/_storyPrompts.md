### First ChatGPT Prompt:

create a prompt that would describe a short movie in the style of early movie animations (those that had an animated lamp 
that jumped around at the beginning of the movie). use the same story instruments and metrics with protagonist and villain. 
it is about a young boy named Theo, dressed in play armor, holding a plastic shield and sword with a helmet that is 
slightly too large. 

He raises his voice and excitedly tells his mom (named Jordie) and dad (named Alex) "Mom, Dad, I am going outside to fight 
the evil dragon that is destroying the neighborhood." his mom busy with housework and dad working on his computer smile 
and revel in their young son's imagination, grant permission while looking briefly at one another and laughing. 

both go back to working and Theo goes outside. outside the neighborhood looks like well-kept suburbia. as he shuffles 
down the street, barely able to see because of his helmet, the clouds darken and a large fire breathing dragon descends 
through the dark sky spuing fire. Theo launches into action, and they fight a vicious battle. Theo overcomes the dragon, 
and it falls unconscious onto the street. He climbs on top of the dragon's mighty head and lifts his sword high above 
his head and pauses with a victorious smile on his face. instead of slaying the dragon with his sword, he yells, "BAD DRAGON!" 
and lifts a foot up high and stomps the top of the dragon's head with the bottom of his foot. a mysterious energy emission 
explodes from the point of impact and swirls around in a vortex that sucks the dragon upward. Theo jumps off the dragon 
and rolls on the ground as the dragon spins upward into the dark sky and electrified vortex. lightning bolts fill the 
sky as the vortex consumes the dragon and spirals upwards into the clouds. the violent sky completely consumes the 
dragon, and the dark clouds settle back to the state seen before the appearance of the dragon. the clouds' part and the 
sun shines through them again. sunbeams fall from the sky and settle on our hero Theo who is still on the ground. 

he stands up and smiles wide as he straightens his play armor. his helmet is again noticeably too large. 
He begins walking home. the dark clouds have completely gone now and the neighborhood has completely been restored to 
its former peace. 3 blue birds fly into the scene as theo walks and flies around him once or twice before one of the 
blue birds lands on the tip of his sword.  the bird says in a high pitched bird like voice "Thanks Theo! You saved us all!" 
the bird rejoins his friends. and theo continues to walk home. from inside the house, theo can be seen coming through 
the door. he shuts the door and takes off his helmet and armor. he pauses, tilts his head and loudly questions 
"What's for dinner, Mom?" Jordie can be heard in the other room answering "macaroni and cheese."  Theo smiles big, and 
runs past the fixed position camera (like hurrying off to get his favorite meal). 

the camera stays fixed on the door from the inside of the house where theo had just taken off his armor. the armor is 
in view. the words "The End" fade in and then fades to black. use the prompt guide to create the elements of 
the story in scenes using descriptive language.

### ChatGPT Response:

Below are **scene-by-scene LTX‑2 prompts** (each one is a **single flowing paragraph, present tense, 4–8 sentences**) to generate a short movie with **early-era CG animation vibes**—playful squash-and-stretch, simple suburban sets, slightly plasticky materials, and a **generic bouncing desk-lamp intro** (without referencing any specific real studio/brand).

---

## Scene 1 — Vintage lamp intro transition into the story

Early-era 3D computer animation with a retro 4:3 frame, gentle film grain, slightly plasticky textures, and playful squash-and-stretch physics: a small, generic white desk lamp hops into frame on a clean neutral stage, its springy neck bobbing as it lands with squeaky rubbery sound effects. The lamp pauses, “looks” toward the camera by tilting its shade, then does two quick excited bounces as a short orchestral jingle swells. It turns its bulb toward us and clicks on, blasting a warm cone of light that fills the screen like a bright wipe transition. The lamp’s beam becomes the sunlight of the next scene as the audio shifts into cozy home ambience, creating a smooth match-cut from “studio intro” to story world.

---

## Scene 2 — Inside the house: Theo announces his quest

Early-era 3D animation, warm morning light through a suburban window, soft shadows, and a cozy, simple family-room set: an 8-year-old boy named **Theo** stands in play armor with an oversized helmet that sits too low on his brow, a plastic shield strapped to one arm and a plastic sword in the other. He puffs his chest, feet planted wide, and excitedly raises his voice, saying, **“Mom, Dad, I am going outside to fight the evil dragon that is destroying the neighborhood.”** In the background, **Jordie** (mom) is busy with housework, and **Alex** (dad) sits at a computer desk working, both smiling with amused pride. The camera holds a medium-wide framing as Jordie and Alex briefly glance at each other and laugh softly, then nod permission with affectionate expressions. Theo bounces on his toes as if already hearing heroic music, and the soundtrack adds a playful, adventurous flourish under his words.

---

## Scene 3 — Theo exits; parents return to their routines

Same retro 3D animation style and lighting continuity: the camera gently dollies toward the front door as Theo shuffles past, his helmet comically wobbling and blocking part of his vision. Jordie gives a final fond smile while Alex’s shoulders lift in a quiet chuckle, then both turn back to their tasks—Jordie resumes tidying, and Alex refocuses on the computer screen. Theo grips his plastic sword like a real knight and pushes the door open with a determined little grunt. The door swings wide and sunlight spills across the floor, and the ambience shifts to outdoor birds and distant neighborhood quiet. Theo steps out, and the door closes behind him with a soft, satisfying click as the music turns more “quest-like.”

---

## Scene 4 — Suburban street; clouds begin to darken

Early-era 3D animation, wide establishing shot of **well-kept suburbia** with bright lawns, neat sidewalks, and friendly colors: Theo appears small in frame, marching down the street with earnest determination while his oversized helmet makes him tilt his head and shuffle to see. The camera transitions into a slow, child-height tracking move beside him, emphasizing his toy armor’s shiny, plastic surfaces. Gentle wind rustles leaves, and the cheerful ambience slowly thins as the light subtly cools. Overhead, clouds begin to gather, dimming the sun in a readable, gradual change rather than chaotic weather. Theo’s posture stiffens—he raises his shield slightly, as if his imagination has become real, and the music adds a low, suspenseful undertone.

---

## Scene 5 — The villain arrives: dragon descends with fire

In the same stylized retro CG look, the camera tilts up from Theo to the sky as the clouds deepen into dramatic gray and a **large fire-breathing dragon** breaks through the darkness, wings beating with heavy, animated weight. The dragon’s scales gleam with simple highlights, and its breath ignites into a bright, cartoon-readable stream of flame that licks across the air above the street without becoming visually chaotic. Theo steps into a brave stance, plastic sword forward, shield up, knees bent, his helmet still slightly too large and slipping low. The dragon roars, and the sound design layers thunder-like rumbles with classic animated creature growls. Theo charges with a high-pitched battle yell, and the camera pulls back to keep both hero and villain clearly visible in a dramatic wide shot. The score swells into heroic action, signaling the start of the showdown.

---

## Scene 6 — The battle: clear, vicious-but-readable action

Retro 3D animation with clean staging: the camera stays at a medium-wide distance so the choreography reads clearly as Theo dodges a burst of flame by ducking behind his plastic shield, the shield reflecting warm light. The dragon swipes a claw into the pavement, cracking it in exaggerated animated chunks, while Theo counters with quick, determined sword taps that look toy-light but heroically timed. Theo circles, feet scuffing the street, and the helmet bobbles comedically as he commits to each move, showing courage through posture rather than facial subtlety. The dragon lunges; Theo rolls aside and pops up with a triumphant little gasp, then jabs upward as if striking a weak spot beneath the jaw. A final exchange lands: Theo braces, pushes forward with both hands, and the dragon staggers back, its roar turning into a surprised grunt. The music hits a punchy crescendo as the dragon’s legs buckle.

---

## Scene 7 — Climax: Theo wins, “BAD DRAGON!”, stomp vortex

Early-era CG style, dramatic but readable: the dragon collapses unconscious onto the street with a heavy thud, and dust puffs outward in a stylized ring. Theo climbs onto the dragon’s mighty head, standing tall despite his wobbly helmet, and lifts his plastic sword overhead, pausing with a victorious grin as the music holds a heroic note. Instead of striking, Theo shouts, **“BAD DRAGON!”** and raises one foot high, then stomps the top of the dragon’s head with the bottom of his shoe. At the instant of impact, a mysterious energy emission bursts out—bright, swirling, and cartoon-electric—forming a spinning vortex that wraps around the dragon’s body. Theo jumps off and tumbles into a safe roll on the pavement as the dragon spirals upward into the dark sky, lightning bolts flickering around the vortex in rhythmic flashes. The dragon vanishes into the clouds, and the sound peaks with a thunder-crack that cuts cleanly into sudden calm.

---

## Scene 8 — Resolution outdoors: calm returns, birds thank Theo

The stormy sky settles back to normal in a clear visual reset: the dark clouds soften and part, sunlight pours through, and the neighborhood’s colors return to bright, peaceful suburbia. Sunbeams land on Theo as he lies on the ground, then he rises, smiling wide, and straightens his play armor with proud little pats; his oversized helmet is again noticeably too large and slightly crooked. The camera dollies in gently to capture his satisfied expression and relaxed shoulders as the music turns warm and triumphant. Three blue birds flutter into frame, circling Theo once or twice in a playful loop, their wings beating with light, cartoony rhythm. One bird lands delicately on the tip of Theo’s plastic sword and chirps in a high-pitched birdlike voice, **“Thanks Theo! You saved us all!”** The bird hops off and rejoins its friends, and Theo nods with quiet hero confidence as he starts walking home.

---

## Scene 9 — Return home: Theo enters, removes armor, asks about dinner

Same retro 3D animation style, interior match-cut: from inside the house near the front door, Theo comes through the doorway, the camera placed in a fixed, slightly low angle like a classic animated short. He shuts the door, then removes his oversized helmet and play armor piece by piece, setting them down in view with soft plastic clacks. Theo pauses, tilts his head toward the other room, and calls loudly, **“What’s for dinner, Mom?”** Offscreen, Jordie answers clearly, **“macaroni and cheese.”** Theo’s face lights up into a huge grin, and he suddenly sprints past the fixed camera with quick little footsteps, as if rushing to his favorite meal. The ambience is cozy again—faint household sounds and a gentle musical tag that signals “home safe.”

---

## Scene 10 — End card: fixed shot on the armor, fade out

Early-era animated short ending, fixed camera, quiet domestic lighting: the door and the neatly placed play armor remain in frame, now still and peaceful. The music resolves into a soft, satisfying final chord as the room tone settles, emphasizing the calm after adventure. A simple end title appears as a clean fade-in—**“The End”**—then holds briefly before fading away. The image fades to black with a gentle film-grain texture lingering in the darkness for a beat. A tiny, playful orchestral stinger closes the short, like a classic animated end tag.

---

### Optional consistency line (prepend to every scene if you want tighter continuity)

**“Stylized early-era 3D animation, retro 4:3 frame, subtle film grain, toy-like plasticky materials, squash-and-stretch motion, family-friendly comedic timing, clear readable staging, orchestral cartoon score, clean sound effects.”**

If you want, I can also compress these into **fewer, longer scenes** (for fewer generations) while keeping the same protagonist/villain arc: **inciting announcement → permission → rising dread → dragon attack → fight → stomp vortex climax → restoration → gratitude → home dinner button → end card**.

### Second ChatGPT Prompt:

convert the ratio to 16:9 and break each scene into shots lasting no longer than 10 seconds each

### ChatGPT Response:

Below is a **16:9 (widescreen) shot list**, with **each shot designed to play in ≤10 seconds**. Each shot is written as a **single flowing LTX‑2 paragraph** (present tense, cinematic, 4–8 sentences), and keeps the **early-era 3D animation vibe** with squash-and-stretch, slightly plasticky materials, simple suburban sets, and a generic bouncing lamp intro.

---

## Global style to keep consistent across every shot

**Early-era 3D computer animation, 16:9 widescreen, subtle film grain, slightly plasticky toy-like materials, gentle squash-and-stretch motion, clean readable staging, family-friendly orchestral cartoon score, clear sound effects, warm lighting indoors and bright suburbia outdoors.**

---

# Scene 1 — Retro lamp intro

### Shot 1.1 (6–8s)

16:9 retro 3D animation on a clean neutral stage: a small, generic white desk lamp hops into frame with springy squash-and-stretch, landing with a soft rubbery squeak and a cheerful orchestral jingle. The camera holds a simple medium-wide framing as the lamp bounces twice more, its shade “looking” around by tilting left and right. The bulb flickers playfully like it’s excited to begin, and the jingle swells in brightness. The lamp settles, facing the camera, as if preparing a transition.

### Shot 1.2 (5–7s)

In 16:9 widescreen, the lamp leans forward and clicks on with a crisp “tink,” projecting a warm cone of light toward camera. The beam blooms until it fills the screen, creating a bright wipe transition as the orchestral jingle resolves. Inside the light, the audio crossfades into cozy household ambience—soft room tone, distant clinks, and gentle morning birds outside a window. The wipe completes into the next interior scene seamlessly.

---

# Scene 2 — Theo announces his quest

### Shot 2.1 (7–10s)

16:9 interior, warm morning light and simple retro CG textures: Theo, an 8-year-old boy in play armor, stands centered in a medium-wide shot with a helmet slightly too large that dips low on his brow. He grips a plastic sword and shield with proud posture—feet wide, chest puffed, eyes bright beneath the helmet’s rim. He raises his voice with excited certainty and says, **“Mom, Dad, I am going outside to fight the evil dragon that is destroying the neighborhood.”** The camera slowly dollies in just a little to emphasize his heroic seriousness, while a playful adventure motif begins under his words.

### Shot 2.2 (6–9s)

Cut to a 16:9 medium shot that includes Jordie and Alex in the background of their daily routines: Jordie is busy with housework, and Alex sits at a computer, both smiling as they watch Theo’s performance. They glance at each other, share a brief laugh, and nod permission with affectionate expressions, their shoulders relaxed and faces warmly amused. The music stays light and supportive, like a parent-approved “quest theme,” and you hear a soft chuckle from Alex. They return their attention to chores and the computer as the moment ends, keeping Theo’s imagination treated as something wonderful.

---

# Scene 3 — Theo exits; parents return to normal

### Shot 3.1 (6–9s)

16:9 camera at child-height, gently tracking: Theo shuffles toward the front door, his oversized helmet wobbling comically and partially blocking his view so he tilts his head to see. The plastic sword bumps lightly against his shield with each step, making toy-like clacks. He pushes the door open with determined effort, and bright sunlight spills across the floor in a warm rectangular patch. Outdoor ambience—breezy leaves and distant birds—begins to creep in as the door swings wide.

### Shot 3.2 (5–8s)

From a 16:9 interior angle facing the door, Theo steps outside and the door closes with a soft, satisfying click. Jordie resumes housework and Alex refocuses on his computer, both still smiling faintly as if the moment brightened their day. The camera remains steady and calm, emphasizing the normalcy inside. The orchestral theme lightly pivots from cozy to adventurous as the soundscape transitions fully outdoors.

---

# Scene 4 — Suburbia, then the mood shifts

### Shot 4.1 (6–9s)

16:9 wide establishing shot of well-kept suburbia: neat lawns, clean sidewalks, tidy houses, and bright morning colors with simple retro CG geometry. Theo appears small in frame, marching down the street with exaggerated heroic determination, sword held forward like a knight on patrol. The camera holds wide and stable to clearly establish location and scale. Ambient birdsong and a gentle breeze create peaceful contrast with Theo’s “serious mission” energy.

### Shot 4.2 (7–10s)

Cut to a 16:9 side-tracking shot at Theo’s height as he continues down the street, helmet still too large and bobbing with each step. The lighting subtly cools as clouds gather overhead, the sky darkening gradually rather than suddenly, and the cheerful ambience thins. Theo raises his shield slightly, posture tightening in visible readiness. The music shifts to a low suspenseful pulse under the still-peaceful neighborhood sounds.

---

# Scene 5 — The villain arrives

### Shot 5.1 (6–9s)

In 16:9, the camera starts on Theo in a medium shot and slowly tilts up to the sky as the clouds thicken into dramatic gray. A distant shadow crosses the cloud layer, accompanied by a deep rumble that feels like far-off thunder. Theo’s helmeted head follows upward, his stance widening as if bracing for something real. The orchestral score holds a tense sustained note as the shadow grows larger.

### Shot 5.2 (7–10s)

The dragon descends into a 16:9 wide shot, wings beating with heavy animated weight and glossy highlights on its scales. It exhales a bright, cartoon-readable stream of fire above the street, illuminating rooftops in warm flicker without turning the action visually chaotic. Theo snaps into action—shield up, sword forward—and charges with a high-pitched battle yell, tiny but fearless beneath the looming villain. The camera pulls back slightly to keep both hero and dragon in frame as the score surges into full action.

---

# Scene 6 — The battle (clear, readable beats)

### Shot 6.1 (6–9s)

16:9 medium-wide staging: the dragon blasts a short burst of flame toward Theo, and Theo braces behind his plastic shield, the toy surface catching a warm orange reflection. He leans into the impact, feet sliding a little on the pavement in exaggerated cartoon friction. The flame dissipates quickly in a controlled, readable effect as Theo peeks around the shield edge, determined rather than frightened. The music hits rhythmic action accents timed to each movement.

### Shot 6.2 (6–10s)

Cut to a 16:9 wide shot as the dragon swipes a claw into the street, cracking the pavement in chunky, stylized pieces. Theo darts to the side, helmet wobbling so he has to correct his footing to “see,” which adds comedic charm without undermining his bravery. He counters with quick sword taps at the dragon’s forelimb, toy-light but heroically timed, punctuated by crisp plastic “tock” sounds. The dragon recoils with an annoyed growl, and the camera subtly tracks to keep the choreography centered.

### Shot 6.3 (6–9s)

In 16:9, the dragon lunges forward and Theo commits to a clean dodge: he rolls across the pavement, shield tucked in, then pops up into a brave stance. His helmet slips slightly lower during the roll, and he gives a quick head jerk to clear his view, showing determination through action. The camera follows with a small handheld-style sway to add urgency while staying readable. The score rises, then pauses just enough to spotlight Theo’s next move.

### Shot 6.4 (6–10s)

16:9 medium-wide: Theo jabs upward beneath the dragon’s jawline with a decisive thrust, and the dragon staggers back, wings flaring for balance. Theo plants his feet and pushes forward with both hands on the sword grip, posture straining visibly as he commits everything to the final effort. The dragon’s roar breaks into a surprised grunt, then its legs buckle. The music hits a victorious crescendo as the villain teeters, about to fall.

---

# Scene 7 — Victory stomp and vortex banishment

### Shot 7.1 (6–9s)

In 16:9, the dragon collapses unconscious onto the street with a heavy thud, sending a stylized dust puff outward. Theo climbs onto the dragon’s mighty head, the camera in a heroic low angle that makes him look bigger despite his small frame and oversized helmet. He lifts his plastic sword high overhead and holds the pose, smiling with triumph as the orchestra sustains a proud note. The moment is clear, still, and celebratory—an instant of classic animated “hero freeze” before the twist.

### Shot 7.2 (6–9s)

Theo’s expression turns sternly playful as he shouts, **“BAD DRAGON!”** and lifts one foot high over the dragon’s head. He stomps down, and at the impact point a bright, mysterious energy burst erupts—swirling into a tight vortex that wraps around the dragon’s body in clean spirals. Theo jumps off immediately, landing in a quick, safe tumble to the side as the vortex intensifies. The sound design layers a magical electric hum with a punchy cartoon impact hit.

### Shot 7.3 (7–10s)

16:9 wide shot: the vortex lifts the dragon upward, spinning it into the dark sky while lightning bolts flicker rhythmically around the spiral. Theo rolls once more on the pavement and ends on his side, shielding his eyes from the brightness as the dragon vanishes into the clouds. A strong thunder-crack marks the moment the vortex consumes the villain completely. The clouds rapidly settle back to normal, and the audio drops into calm, letting the victory land.

---

# Scene 8 — Peace restored; birds thank Theo

### Shot 8.1 (6–9s)

In 16:9, the clouds part and sunlight pours through, restoring the neighborhood’s bright, peaceful color palette. Theo lies on the ground for a beat, then sits up and stands, smiling wide as he straightens his play armor with proud little pats. His helmet is still noticeably too large and slightly crooked, adding gentle comedy to the heroic image. The camera dollies in subtly as the orchestral music resolves into a warm triumphant theme.

### Shot 8.2 (6–10s)

Three blue birds flutter into the 16:9 frame, circling Theo once in a playful loop with light chirps. One bird lands delicately on the tip of Theo’s sword and speaks in a tiny high-pitched birdlike voice, **“Thanks Theo! You saved us all!”** Theo looks at the bird with delighted surprise and a proud grin, holding very still so the moment reads clearly. The bird hops off, rejoins its friends, and they fly alongside Theo as he continues walking home.

---

# Scene 9 — Home again; dinner reveal

### Shot 9.1 (6–9s)

16:9 interior, fixed camera near the front door like a classic animated short: Theo enters the house, shuts the door, and exhales with satisfied relief. He removes his oversized helmet and sets it down, then slips off his play armor pieces one by one, placing them neatly in view with soft plastic clacks. The room feels cozy and safe, with warm indoor lighting and quiet household ambience returning. The adventurous score softens into a gentle “home” motif.

### Shot 9.2 (6–10s)

From the same fixed 16:9 camera position, Theo pauses, tilts his head toward the other room, and calls loudly, **“What’s for dinner, Mom?”** Offscreen, Jordie answers warmly and clearly, **“macaroni and cheese.”** Theo’s face breaks into a huge grin, and he suddenly sprints past the camera with quick footsteps, excitement turning the heroic ending into a kid’s dinner victory. The audio ends on a cheerful musical button as his footsteps fade.

---

# Scene 10 — End frame and fade out

### Shot 10.1 (7–10s)

16:9 fixed shot stays on the quiet entryway where Theo left his helmet and play armor, now still and peaceful. The room tone is soft, and the music resolves into a final gentle chord. A simple centered end title appears and fades in smoothly—**“The End”**—then holds briefly before fading out. The picture fades to black with a subtle film-grain texture lingering for a beat, followed by a tiny orchestral stinger to close.

---

If you want, I can also provide a **“negative prompt / avoidance line”** to keep the look consistent (avoid hyper-real skin, avoid modern glossy cinematic lighting, avoid shaky chaotic action, avoid unreadable clutter), but the shot prompts above are already staged to be clean and readable under the 10-second limit.

### ChatGPT Prompt:

yes

### ChatGPT Response:

Here are **negative prompt / avoidance lines** you can paste into LTX‑2 (either as a dedicated *Negative prompt* field if your UI supports it, or appended at the end of each shot as “Avoid: …”). I’m giving you **one global negative prompt** plus **optional targeted negatives** for this specific short.

---

## Global negative prompt (use on every shot)

**Negative prompt / Avoid:** photorealistic live-action look; modern ultra-detailed CGI; hyper-real skin pores; realistic hair strand simulation; gritty realistic violence; blood, gore, injury detail; horror tone; harsh contrast “cinematic teal-orange” grading; excessive lens flare; extreme depth-of-field blur; unstable character identity; inconsistent clothing; duplicate Theos; extra parents; extra dragons; crowded streets full of people; modern brand logos; readable signage; subtitles; watermarks; UI overlays; glitch artifacts; warped faces; broken anatomy; extra limbs/fingers; melting objects; jittery teleporting motion; chaotic fast camera spins; aggressive handheld shake; extreme motion blur; strobing lights; noisy particle storms that obscure the action; fire covering the entire frame.

---

## Targeted negatives for this film (optional, but helpful)

### 1) Keep the “early animation” vibe (not modern)

**Avoid:** ultra-high realism; complex micro-textures; ray-traced reflections everywhere; cinematic anamorphic bokeh; ultra-smooth perfect physics; modern game-engine look.

### 2) Keep action readable (no chaos)

**Avoid:** rapid spinning camera; whip pans; constant zooming; fight choreography with too many beats at once; flame/explosions filling the screen; lightning flashing so fast it looks like a strobe.

### 3) Maintain Theo’s consistency

**Avoid:** Theo changing age; Theo becoming a teenager/adult; Theo losing the oversized helmet gag; armor turning into real metal; sword/shield becoming real weapons; Theo’s face changing drastically between shots.

### 4) Maintain Jordie + Alex consistency (background only)

**Avoid:** Jordie/Alex swapping roles; parents leaving the house; parents joining the fight; additional family members appearing.

### 5) Dragon design + tone (family-friendly villain)

**Avoid:** grotesque horror dragon; gore; realistic suffering; overly terrifying facial detail; slime/blood; body dismemberment; lingering death imagery.
(You want “big threatening but cartoon-readable” and the “banished by vortex” finish.)

### 6) Text reliability (LTX‑2 can struggle with readable text)

**Avoid:** lots of text on screen; posters; street signs; long written titles; credits crawl.
**Note:** If “The End” becomes garbled, keep it **very large, centered, simple**, and allow it to fade quickly.

### 7) End-of-film fixed camera clarity

**Avoid:** camera moving at the end; cutting away from the armor; clutter blocking the armor; dramatic lighting changes indoors.

---

## Easy “append line” you can tack onto every shot

If you want a short version to paste at the end of each shot prompt:

**Avoid: photorealism, modern ultra-detailed CGI, gore/horror, extra characters, duplicate Theo, inconsistent helmet/armor, chaotic shaky cam, fast spins, heavy motion blur, glitch artifacts, logos/watermarks, lots of readable text/signs.**

---

If you’d like, I can also format your shot prompts into a **copy/paste template** like:

* **Prompt:** (shot paragraph)
* **Negative:** (global negative)
* **Duration:** 8–10s

…so it’s faster to run as a batch.

### ChatGPT Prompt:

yes, use that template for the shot files. output them in yaml files with the format of [act]_[scene]_[shot]__[description].yaml i.e. A01_S01_SH001__dawn_establishing.yml each file is placed in a folder named clips. create the following files. characters.yaml, locations.yaml, loras.yaml and style_bible.yaml. add detailed descriptions for each. for the loras, find the best combination on civitai.com for the prescribed stylings

### ChatGPT Response:

I created the **`clips/` shot YAMLs (16:9, ≤10s each)** using the **Prompt / Negative / Duration** template, plus the four companion files: **`characters.yaml`**, **`locations.yaml`**, **`style_bible.yaml`**, and **`loras.yaml`**.

You can download everything here:

* **[Download the full YAML package (ZIP)](sandbox:/mnt/data/theo_retro_cg_yaml_package.zip)**
* Individual files (if you prefer):

  * [characters.yaml](sandbox:/mnt/data/characters.yaml)
  * [locations.yaml](sandbox:/mnt/data/locations.yaml)
  * [style_bible.yaml](sandbox:/mnt/data/style_bible.yaml)
  * [loras.yaml](sandbox:/mnt/data/loras.yaml)
  * Shot files folder: [clips/](sandbox:/mnt/data/clips)

## Notes about the LoRA research

I wasn’t able to open **civitai.com** pages directly from this environment (the site returned non-retryable errors), so I used **CivArchive mirrors** plus **Hugging Face model cards** that explicitly reference the Civitai originals to select and document the best-fitting LoRAs and their parameters. The key LoRA parameter recommendations in `loras.yaml` are sourced from those mirrors/cards, including:

* **Animation2k-FLUX**: “use it at 1.2 strength” and “no trigger required.”
* **Flux 3D Animation Style LoRA**: recommended weight **0.5–0.8**, **Euler**, **25 steps**, **CFG 3.0**, no trigger required.
* **LH Pixar 3D Style**: trigger **`Pixar3D_flx`**, suggested **20–30 steps**, **CFG 1.0–1.5**, plus size guidance.
* **Pixar Style Lora (SD1.5 lora128)**: trigger **`(pixarstyle:1.25)`** and a note about testing with/without VAE.
* **Pixar Style SDXL LoRA**: Hugging Face card notes it’s adapted from the Civitai model and uses trigger words (e.g., “pixar style”).

If you want, tell me what **exact generator/pipeline** you’re using for video (since “LTX‑2 + LoRAs” varies by tooling), and I can tailor the YAML keys to match that runner’s expected schema (without changing the story content).
