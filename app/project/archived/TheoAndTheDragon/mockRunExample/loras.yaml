Version: 1.0
Project: "Theo vs. The Dragon (Retro CG Short)"
Notes: |
  These LoRA recommendations are aimed at achieving an early-2000s family-friendly 3D animation movie look
  (rounded forms, smooth shading, toy-like materials, clean color palettes). Use them for look-dev frames,
  key art, or reference images that you then match in your video pipeline.

  Compatibility reminder: LoRAs generally must match the base model family (e.g., SD 1.x LoRAs with SD 1.x models,
  SDXL LoRAs with SDXL models, FLUX LoRAs with FLUX base). If your video model doesn't support LoRAs directly,
  use LoRAs to generate consistent reference frames and enforce the style via prompting/conditioning.

LoRAs:
  - Name: "Animation2k-FLUX"
    Type: "Style LoRA"
    BaseModel: "Flux.1 D"
    SourcePlatform: "CivitAI (mirrored/archived)"
    TriggerWords: []   # no trigger required
    RecommendedWeight: 1.2
    KeyTips:
      - "No trigger required; use natural prompting."
      - "Blends well with other LoRAs."

    Notes: |
      The listing is flagged NSFW on the archive, but the style itself can be used safely with family-friendly prompts.

    IdealSizes: ["1024x1024", "1024x1536"]
    Notes: |
      Pushes a polished, heartwarming rounded 3D character aesthetic. Use moderately so you don't lose the
      'slightly retro' feel. Keep branding out of frames; this is only a style direction.

    Notes: |
      Lightweight SD1.5 style LoRA extracted from a Pixar-style checkpoint. Consider testing with and without a VAE,
      as the listing suggests a VAE may not be recommended for this project.

  - Name: "Pixar Style SDXL (pixar-sdxl-lora)"
    Type: "Style LoRA"
    BaseModel: "SDXL 1.0"
    SourcePlatform: "CivitAI (referenced via Hugging Face mirror)"
    TriggerWords: ["pixar style"]
    Notes: |
      The Hugging Face card describes it as adapted from a Civitai model and designed for image-to-image style transfer.
      Use for reference frames and character look-dev; keep prompts focused on 'early-era 3D animation' to avoid looking too modern.

  # Best overall: "early 2000s animation movie" + "smooth 3D animation look"
  - StackName: "FLUX_Primary_RetroCG"
    Goal: "Early-2000s 3D animated movie vibe with smooth stylized shading"
    UseWhen: "Your base model is Flux.1 D (or compatible) and you want the closest match to the prescribed style."
    LoRAs:

    Notes: |
      Keep the total stylization moderate. If faces become too uniform or plasticky, reduce the 3D Animation Style LoRA first.

  - StackName: "FLUX_Heartwarming_Polished"
    Goal: "More heartwarming rounded 3D character appeal while retaining a slightly retro feel"
    UseWhen: "You want the 'classic lamp-intro era' mood, but not a modern glossy render."

      If the look becomes too polished or too on-the-nose, lower LH Pixar 3D Style weight to 0.4–0.5.

UsageTips:
  Prompting:
    - "Emphasize: early-era 3D animation, slightly plasticky materials, squash-and-stretch, clean simple sets, family-friendly."
    - "De-emphasize: photoreal, ultra-detailed textures, sharp cinematic lighting."
  NegativePrompting:
    - "Use strong negatives for: photoreal skin pores, real hair strands, brand logos, readable signage, excessive text."
