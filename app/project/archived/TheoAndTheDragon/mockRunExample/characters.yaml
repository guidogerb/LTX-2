Version: 1.0
Project: "Theo vs. The Dragon (Retro CG Short)"
CharacterGuide:
  GeneralNotes: |
    All characters should read as early-era 3D animation: slightly simplified geometry, rounded forms,
    clean silhouettes, and expressive acting driven by posture and timing (not micro-details).
    Maintain consistent proportions across shots; avoid photoreal textures and avoid brand logos.

Characters:
  Theo:
    Role: "Protagonist (Hero)"
    Age: 8
    BodyType: "Small child proportions, slightly oversized head typical of family-friendly CG shorts."
    SkinTone: "Neutral; keep consistent across shots."
    Hair: "Mostly hidden by helmet; any visible hair should be simple, short, and tidy."
    Costume:
      Armor: |
        Play knight armor made of lightweight plastic with soft scuffs at edges, visible velcro/strap hints,
        toy-like shine (not metal), and slightly chunky kid-friendly shapes.
      Helmet: |
        Plastic helmet that is noticeably too large; it sits low on the brow and wobbles as he moves.
        This is a continuity gag—keep it obvious whenever worn.
      Props:
        Shield: "Small plastic shield with simple molded details; no heraldic logos or readable text."
        Sword: "Plastic sword with rounded tip; bright toy highlights; no realistic blade sharpness."
    ExpressionAndActing:
      Default: "Bright-eyed, eager, fearless in posture; bravery is shown through stance and movement."
      ComedyBeats: "Helmet bobble, partial blocked vision, quick head-tilts to see, proud little armor pats."
      HeroBeats: "Wide stance, shield-forward, decisive roll-to-stand, confident victory freeze."
    Voice:
      Type: "Child voice, energetic and clear."
      Dialogue:
        - "Mom, Dad, I am going outside to fight the evil dragon that is destroying the neighborhood."
        - "BAD DRAGON!"
        - "What's for dinner, Mom?"
    ConsistencyAnchors:
      PromptAnchor: |
        "Theo, 8-year-old boy, play knight armor, oversized helmet too large, plastic shield and plastic sword,
        earnest heroic posture, early-era 3D animation"
      Avoid: |
        "teenager/adult Theo, realistic armor, sharp metal weapons, modern streetwear, hyper-real skin"

  Jordie:
    Role: "Supporting (Mom)"
    AgeRange: "30s–40s"
    BodyType: "Average build, friendly silhouette."
    Wardrobe: "Casual at-home clothing suitable for housework (e.g., simple top and pants), no logos."
    Acting: |
      Warm, amused smile; supportive and affectionate. She stays busy with housework and remains offscreen
      for the dinner response if continuity is difficult.
    Voice:
      Type: "Warm adult voice, calm and practical."
      Dialogue:
        - "macaroni and cheese."
    ConsistencyAnchors:
      PromptAnchor: "Jordie, mom, casual home clothes, warm smile, busy with housework, early-era 3D animation"
      Avoid: "hostile tone, leaving the house, joining the fight"

  Alex:
    Role: "Supporting (Dad)"
    AgeRange: "30s–40s"
    BodyType: "Average build, relaxed posture."
    Wardrobe: "Casual at-home clothing; simple colors; no branding."
    Acting: |
      Quiet amused chuckle, supportive nod. He remains at a computer workstation, briefly glancing at Jordie
      to share the moment, then returns to work.
    Voice:
      Type: "Warm adult voice; minimal dialogue (primarily reaction)."
    ConsistencyAnchors:
      PromptAnchor: "Alex, dad, working at computer desk, gentle laugh, early-era 3D animation"
      Avoid: "changing to a different job/location, dramatic reactions"

  Dragon:
    Role: "Villain (Threatening but Family-Friendly)"
    Scale: "Large enough to dwarf Theo; clearly the dominant figure in wide shots."
    Design: |
      Big readable shapes, glossy stylized scales, expressive brows and mouth, not grotesque.
      Fire breath should be bright and cartoon-readable, controlled in size (never full-frame).
    Movement: |
      Heavy wingbeats, deliberate claw swipes, staged choreography that stays readable and not chaotic.
      Reacts to Theo's toy strikes with exaggerated animation timing.
    Audio: "Deep roar and rumble; no horror scream design."
    Outcome: "Falls unconscious, then is banished by a magical vortex (no gore, no slaying)."
    ConsistencyAnchors:
      PromptAnchor: "large stylized dragon, glossy scales, family-friendly, early-era 3D animation, readable fire breath"
      Avoid: "horror dragon, gore, realistic suffering"

  BlueBirds:
    Role: "Supporting (Gratitude Chorus)"
    Count: 3
    Design: "Simple rounded blue birds with tiny beaks; bright friendly eyes; quick flutter motion."
    Acting: |
      Fly into scene, circle Theo once or twice, then one bird lands on the tip of Theo's sword.
      Keep the flight path simple and readable.
    Voice:
      Type: "High-pitched birdlike voice."
      Dialogue:
        - "Thanks Theo! You saved us all!"
    ConsistencyAnchors:
      PromptAnchor: "three small blue birds, cute, early-era 3D animation, one bird perches on sword tip"
      Avoid: "more than three birds, different species, long complex flocking patterns"

  Lamp:
    Role: "Intro Mascot (Generic Desk Lamp, Non-branded)"
    Design: |
      Generic white desk lamp with a springy neck and round base; no logos; no recognizable studio marks.
      Uses squash-and-stretch for comedic bounces.
    Acting: "Hops into frame, tilts shade like eye contact, clicks on to create a wipe transition."
    Audio: "Soft rubber squeaks, crisp click, cheerful orchestral jingle."
    ConsistencyAnchors:
      PromptAnchor: "generic desk lamp, white, springy, squash-and-stretch, retro CG intro"
      Avoid: "any brand-specific lamp or studio logo"
