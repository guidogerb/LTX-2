Prompt: |
  16:9 shot with soft daylight: three blue birds flutter into frame and circle Theo once in a playful loop,
  their chirps bright against the now-calm suburb. One bird lands delicately on the tip of Theo’s plastic sword
  and speaks in a tiny high-pitched birdlike voice, “Thanks Theo! You saved us all!” Theo holds very still so
  the moment reads cleanly, then grins with proud surprise and gives a small nod. The bird hops off to rejoin
  its friends, and the trio flits alongside Theo as he walks toward home.

Negative: |
  photorealistic live-action look; modern ultra-detailed CGI; hyper-real skin pores; realistic hair strand
  simulation; gritty realistic violence; blood; gore; injury detail; horror tone; harsh contrast teal-orange
  grading; excessive lens flare; extreme depth-of-field blur; unstable character identity; inconsistent
  clothing; duplicate Theo; extra parents; extra dragons; crowded streets full of people; modern brand logos;
  readable signage; subtitles; watermarks; UI overlays; glitch artifacts; warped faces; broken anatomy; extra
  limbs/fingers; melting objects; jittery teleporting motion; chaotic fast camera spins; aggressive handheld
  shake; extreme motion blur; strobing lights; noisy particle storms that obscure the action; fire/explosions
  filling the entire frame; lots of on-screen text; credits crawl. Avoid: birds turning into different species;
  avoid extra talking animals; keep exactly three birds.
