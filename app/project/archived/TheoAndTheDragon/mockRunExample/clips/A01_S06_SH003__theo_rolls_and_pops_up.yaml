Prompt: |
  16:9 medium shot with a slight handheld sway for urgency: the dragon lunges forward and Theo commits to a
  clean dodge, rolling across the pavement with shield tucked in. He pops up into a brave stance, and his helmet
  slips lower so he gives a quick head jerk to clear his view, refusing to break focus. The dragon’s breath
  whooshes past in the background, and Theo’s posture stays squared and confident. The orchestral score rises,
  then briefly thins to spotlight Theo preparing his next decisive move.

Negative: |
  photorealistic live-action look; modern ultra-detailed CGI; hyper-real skin pores; realistic hair strand
  simulation; gritty realistic violence; blood; gore; injury detail; horror tone; harsh contrast teal-orange
  grading; excessive lens flare; extreme depth-of-field blur; unstable character identity; inconsistent
  clothing; duplicate Theo; extra parents; extra dragons; crowded streets full of people; modern brand logos;
  readable signage; subtitles; watermarks; UI overlays; glitch artifacts; warped faces; broken anatomy; extra
  limbs/fingers; melting objects; jittery teleporting motion; chaotic fast camera spins; aggressive handheld
  shake; extreme motion blur; strobing lights; noisy particle storms that obscure the action; fire/explosions
  filling the entire frame; lots of on-screen text; credits crawl. Avoid: chaotic camera shake; avoid motion
  blur smearing Theo’s face; keep roll readable.

ContinuityNotes: |
  Maintain early-era 3D animation look: slightly plasticky materials, gentle squash-and-stretch, readable
  staging. Keep Theo’s helmet noticeably too large whenever he is wearing it. Dragon is threatening but family-
  friendly; no gore, no injury detail. Action must stay readable: controlled fire, controlled lightning, no
  chaotic camera spins.
