Prompt: |
  Cut to a 16:9 medium shot that frames Jordie and Alex in the same room: Jordie keeps busy with housework in
  the foreground while Alex types at a computer desk, both wearing relaxed, casual clothes and smiling at Theo’s
  imagination. They glance at each other and laugh quietly, then nod permission with affectionate expressions,
  communicating trust and warmth through posture and soft eye crinkles. The camera holds steady to keep their
  acting readable, and the music stays light and supportive. They turn back to chores and the computer, still
  smiling, as Theo moves off toward the door out of frame.

Negative: |
  photorealistic live-action look; modern ultra-detailed CGI; hyper-real skin pores; realistic hair strand
  simulation; gritty realistic violence; blood; gore; injury detail; horror tone; harsh contrast teal-orange
  grading; excessive lens flare; extreme depth-of-field blur; unstable character identity; inconsistent
  clothing; duplicate Theo; extra parents; extra dragons; crowded streets full of people; modern brand logos;
  readable signage; subtitles; watermarks; UI overlays; glitch artifacts; warped faces; broken anatomy; extra
  limbs/fingers; melting objects; jittery teleporting motion; chaotic fast camera spins; aggressive handheld
  shake; extreme motion blur; strobing lights; noisy particle storms that obscure the action; fire/explosions
  filling the entire frame; lots of on-screen text; credits crawl. Avoid: parents leaving the house; avoid
  adding extra family members; keep expressions warm not sarcastic.
