Prompt: |
  16:9 wide shot: a large fire-breathing dragon descends through the dark sky, wings beating with heavy animated
  weight and glossy highlights on its scales. It exhales a bright, cartoon-readable stream of fire above the
  street, casting warm flicker on rooftops without filling the whole frame. Theo charges forward with a high-
  pitched battle yell, shield raised and plastic sword pointed up, tiny but fearless beneath the looming
  villain. The camera pulls back slightly to keep both hero and dragon readable as the orchestral score surges
  into full action.

Negative: |
  photorealistic live-action look; modern ultra-detailed CGI; hyper-real skin pores; realistic hair strand
  simulation; gritty realistic violence; blood; gore; injury detail; horror tone; harsh contrast teal-orange
  grading; excessive lens flare; extreme depth-of-field blur; unstable character identity; inconsistent
  clothing; duplicate Theo; extra parents; extra dragons; crowded streets full of people; modern brand logos;
  readable signage; subtitles; watermarks; UI overlays; glitch artifacts; warped faces; broken anatomy; extra
  limbs/fingers; melting objects; jittery teleporting motion; chaotic fast camera spins; aggressive handheld
  shake; extreme motion blur; strobing lights; noisy particle storms that obscure the action; fire/explosions
  filling the entire frame; lots of on-screen text; credits crawl. Avoid: gore or realistic horror dragon; avoid
  fire covering the entire frame; keep dragon threatening but family-friendly.

ContinuityNotes: |
  Maintain early-era 3D animation look: slightly plasticky materials, gentle squash-and-stretch, readable
  staging. Keep Theo’s helmet noticeably too large whenever he is wearing it. Dragon is threatening but family-
  friendly; no gore, no injury detail.
