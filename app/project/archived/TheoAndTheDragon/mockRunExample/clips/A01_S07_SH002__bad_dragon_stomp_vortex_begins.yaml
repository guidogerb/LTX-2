Prompt: |
  Same 16:9 angle, still in early-era CG: Theo turns sternly playful and shouts, “BAD DRAGON!” He raises one
  foot high and stomps the top of the dragon’s head, and at the impact point a bright magical energy burst
  erupts and spirals into a tight vortex. Theo immediately jumps off and tumbles safely to the side in a clean,
  readable roll, shielding his face from the glow. The sound design layers a punchy cartoon stomp with an
  electric humming swirl as the vortex strengthens.

Negative: |
  photorealistic live-action look; modern ultra-detailed CGI; hyper-real skin pores; realistic hair strand
  simulation; gritty realistic violence; blood; gore; injury detail; horror tone; harsh contrast teal-orange
  grading; excessive lens flare; extreme depth-of-field blur; unstable character identity; inconsistent
  clothing; duplicate Theo; extra parents; extra dragons; crowded streets full of people; modern brand logos;
  readable signage; subtitles; watermarks; UI overlays; glitch artifacts; warped faces; broken anatomy; extra
  limbs/fingers; melting objects; jittery teleporting motion; chaotic fast camera spins; aggressive handheld
  shake; extreme motion blur; strobing lights; noisy particle storms that obscure the action; fire/explosions
  filling the entire frame; lots of on-screen text; credits crawl. Avoid: explosive gore; avoid energy effects
  that fill the entire frame; keep vortex clean and readable.

ContinuityNotes: |
  Maintain early-era 3D animation look: slightly plasticky materials, gentle squash-and-stretch, readable
  staging. Keep Theo’s helmet noticeably too large whenever he is wearing it. Dragon is threatening but family-
  friendly; no gore, no injury detail. Action must stay readable: controlled fire, controlled lightning, no
  chaotic camera spins.
