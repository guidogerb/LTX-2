Prompt: |
  16:9 medium-wide: Theo jabs upward beneath the dragon’s jawline with a decisive thrust, and the dragon
  staggers back with wings flaring to regain balance. Theo plants his feet and pushes forward with both hands on
  the sword grip, body leaning in with visible strain and determination. The dragon’s roar breaks into a
  surprised grunt and its legs buckle, wobbling like a toppled statue. The music hits a clean victorious
  crescendo as the villain begins to collapse.

Negative: |
  photorealistic live-action look; modern ultra-detailed CGI; hyper-real skin pores; realistic hair strand
  simulation; gritty realistic violence; blood; gore; injury detail; horror tone; harsh contrast teal-orange
  grading; excessive lens flare; extreme depth-of-field blur; unstable character identity; inconsistent
  clothing; duplicate Theo; extra parents; extra dragons; crowded streets full of people; modern brand logos;
  readable signage; subtitles; watermarks; UI overlays; glitch artifacts; warped faces; broken anatomy; extra
  limbs/fingers; melting objects; jittery teleporting motion; chaotic fast camera spins; aggressive handheld
  shake; extreme motion blur; strobing lights; noisy particle storms that obscure the action; fire/explosions
  filling the entire frame; lots of on-screen text; credits crawl. Avoid: Theo turning into an adult hero; avoid
  realistic impalement; keep contact implied and family-friendly.

ContinuityNotes: |
  Maintain early-era 3D animation look: slightly plasticky materials, gentle squash-and-stretch, readable
  staging. Keep Theo’s helmet noticeably too large whenever he is wearing it. Dragon is threatening but family-
  friendly; no gore, no injury detail. Action must stay readable: controlled fire, controlled lightning, no
  chaotic camera spins.
