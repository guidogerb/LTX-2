Prompt: |
  16:9 medium-wide staging with clean retro CG: the dragon blasts a short burst of flame toward Theo, and Theo
  braces behind his plastic shield, its toy surface reflecting warm orange light. He leans into the ‘impact’
  with exaggerated cartoon friction, feet sliding a little but not losing ground. The flame dissipates quickly
  in a controlled effect, and Theo peeks out with determined eyes and a clenched jaw. The music hits crisp
  action accents timed to shield raise, flame burst, and Theo’s steady recovery.

Negative: |
  photorealistic live-action look; modern ultra-detailed CGI; hyper-real skin pores; realistic hair strand
  simulation; gritty realistic violence; blood; gore; injury detail; horror tone; harsh contrast teal-orange
  grading; excessive lens flare; extreme depth-of-field blur; unstable character identity; inconsistent
  clothing; duplicate Theo; extra parents; extra dragons; crowded streets full of people; modern brand logos;
  readable signage; subtitles; watermarks; UI overlays; glitch artifacts; warped faces; broken anatomy; extra
  limbs/fingers; melting objects; jittery teleporting motion; chaotic fast camera spins; aggressive handheld
  shake; extreme motion blur; strobing lights; noisy particle storms that obscure the action; fire/explosions
  filling the entire frame; lots of on-screen text; credits crawl. Avoid: long continuous flamethrower; avoid
  excessive smoke particles obscuring Theo.

ContinuityNotes: |
  Maintain early-era 3D animation look: slightly plasticky materials, gentle squash-and-stretch, readable
  staging. Keep Theo’s helmet noticeably too large whenever he is wearing it. Dragon is threatening but family-
  friendly; no gore, no injury detail. Action must stay readable: controlled fire, controlled lightning, no
  chaotic camera spins.
