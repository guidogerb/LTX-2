Prompt: |
  Cut to a 16:9 wide shot: the dragon swipes a claw into the pavement, cracking the street into chunky stylized
  pieces that pop upward and settle. Theo darts sideways, helmet wobbling so he has to correct his footing to
  see, then counters with quick toy-sword taps at the dragon’s forelimb. Plastic “tock” sound effects punctuate
  each strike while the dragon growls in annoyed surprise. The camera tracks just enough to keep both figures
  centered and the choreography easy to follow.

Negative: |
  photorealistic live-action look; modern ultra-detailed CGI; hyper-real skin pores; realistic hair strand
  simulation; gritty realistic violence; blood; gore; injury detail; horror tone; harsh contrast teal-orange
  grading; excessive lens flare; extreme depth-of-field blur; unstable character identity; inconsistent
  clothing; duplicate Theo; extra parents; extra dragons; crowded streets full of people; modern brand logos;
  readable signage; subtitles; watermarks; UI overlays; glitch artifacts; warped faces; broken anatomy; extra
  limbs/fingers; melting objects; jittery teleporting motion; chaotic fast camera spins; aggressive handheld
  shake; extreme motion blur; strobing lights; noisy particle storms that obscure the action; fire/explosions
  filling the entire frame; lots of on-screen text; credits crawl. Avoid: debris flying into the lens; avoid
  ultra-realistic destruction; keep cracks stylized and clean.

ContinuityNotes: |
  Maintain early-era 3D animation look: slightly plasticky materials, gentle squash-and-stretch, readable
  staging. Keep Theo’s helmet noticeably too large whenever he is wearing it. Dragon is threatening but family-
  friendly; no gore, no injury detail. Action must stay readable: controlled fire, controlled lightning, no
  chaotic camera spins.
