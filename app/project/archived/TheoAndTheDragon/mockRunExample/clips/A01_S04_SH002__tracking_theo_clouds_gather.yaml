Prompt: |
  Side-tracking 16:9 shot at Theo’s height: he continues shuffling forward, helmet bobbling comically as he
  peers out from under its rim. The sunlight subtly cools as clouds gather overhead, dimming the street in a
  gradual, readable change. Theo tightens his posture and lifts his shield a little higher, showing bravery
  through action rather than words. The music shifts into a low suspense pulse while the ambient birds fade
  slightly, as if the world is holding its breath.

Negative: |
  photorealistic live-action look; modern ultra-detailed CGI; hyper-real skin pores; realistic hair strand
  simulation; gritty realistic violence; blood; gore; injury detail; horror tone; harsh contrast teal-orange
  grading; excessive lens flare; extreme depth-of-field blur; unstable character identity; inconsistent
  clothing; duplicate Theo; extra parents; extra dragons; crowded streets full of people; modern brand logos;
  readable signage; subtitles; watermarks; UI overlays; glitch artifacts; warped faces; broken anatomy; extra
  limbs/fingers; melting objects; jittery teleporting motion; chaotic fast camera spins; aggressive handheld
  shake; extreme motion blur; strobing lights; noisy particle storms that obscure the action; fire/explosions
  filling the entire frame; lots of on-screen text; credits crawl. Avoid: instant storm jump-cuts; avoid overly
  dark night lighting; keep it clearly daytime turning overcast.
