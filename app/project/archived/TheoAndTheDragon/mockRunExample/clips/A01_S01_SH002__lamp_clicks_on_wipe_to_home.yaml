Prompt: |
  Same retro CG look in 16:9: the lamp leans forward, clicks on with a crisp “tink,” and its warm beam blooms
  toward the lens. The camera stays locked as the cone of light grows into a full-screen white wipe, keeping
  motion clean and readable. The orchestral jingle resolves into a final chord while household ambience fades in
  underneath—soft room tone, distant clinks, and faint morning birds. The wipe completes into the next interior
  scene as if the lamp’s beam becomes the sunlight in a home window.

Negative: |
  photorealistic live-action look; modern ultra-detailed CGI; hyper-real skin pores; realistic hair strand
  simulation; gritty realistic violence; blood; gore; injury detail; horror tone; harsh contrast teal-orange
  grading; excessive lens flare; extreme depth-of-field blur; unstable character identity; inconsistent
  clothing; duplicate Theo; extra parents; extra dragons; crowded streets full of people; modern brand logos;
  readable signage; subtitles; watermarks; UI overlays; glitch artifacts; warped faces; broken anatomy; extra
  limbs/fingers; melting objects; jittery teleporting motion; chaotic fast camera spins; aggressive handheld
  shake; extreme motion blur; strobing lights; noisy particle storms that obscure the action; fire/explosions
  filling the entire frame; lots of on-screen text; credits crawl. Avoid: harsh strobing, overexposed blowout
  that loses all detail for too long.

  staging. Keep Theo’s helmet noticeably too large whenever he is wearing it.
