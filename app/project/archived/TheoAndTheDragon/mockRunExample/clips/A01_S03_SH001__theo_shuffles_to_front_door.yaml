Prompt: |
  16:9 child-height tracking shot in the same retro 3D style: Theo shuffles toward the front door, his oversized
  helmet wobbling and blocking part of his view so he tilts his head to see. His plastic sword bumps lightly
  against the shield, making toy-like clacks that match his determined march. The camera glides beside him as he
  reaches the door handle and pushes, sunlight spilling across the floor in a warm rectangle. Outdoor
  ambience—breeze and distant birds—starts to leak in as the door swings open.

Negative: |
  photorealistic live-action look; modern ultra-detailed CGI; hyper-real skin pores; realistic hair strand
  simulation; gritty realistic violence; blood; gore; injury detail; horror tone; harsh contrast teal-orange
  grading; excessive lens flare; extreme depth-of-field blur; unstable character identity; inconsistent
  clothing; duplicate Theo; extra parents; extra dragons; crowded streets full of people; modern brand logos;
  readable signage; subtitles; watermarks; UI overlays; glitch artifacts; warped faces; broken anatomy; extra
  limbs/fingers; melting objects; jittery teleporting motion; chaotic fast camera spins; aggressive handheld
  shake; extreme motion blur; strobing lights; noisy particle storms that obscure the action; fire/explosions
  filling the entire frame; lots of on-screen text; credits crawl. Avoid: cluttered doorway; avoid fast shaky
  cam; keep motion smooth and readable.
