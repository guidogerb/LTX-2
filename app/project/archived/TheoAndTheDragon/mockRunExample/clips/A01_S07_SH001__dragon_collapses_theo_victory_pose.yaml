Prompt: |
  16:9 wide shot: the dragon collapses unconscious onto the street with a heavy thud, sending a stylized dust
  puff outward in a neat ring. Theo climbs onto the dragon’s mighty head, and the camera drops into a heroic low
  angle that makes him look larger despite his small frame. He lifts his plastic sword overhead and freezes in a
  triumphant pose, wearing a broad victorious smile while his oversized helmet sits comically askew. The
  orchestra holds a proud sustained note, creating a classic animated ‘hero moment’ beat.

Negative: |
  photorealistic live-action look; modern ultra-detailed CGI; hyper-real skin pores; realistic hair strand
  simulation; gritty realistic violence; blood; gore; injury detail; horror tone; harsh contrast teal-orange
  grading; excessive lens flare; extreme depth-of-field blur; unstable character identity; inconsistent
  clothing; duplicate Theo; extra parents; extra dragons; crowded streets full of people; modern brand logos;
  readable signage; subtitles; watermarks; UI overlays; glitch artifacts; warped faces; broken anatomy; extra
  limbs/fingers; melting objects; jittery teleporting motion; chaotic fast camera spins; aggressive handheld
  shake; extreme motion blur; strobing lights; noisy particle storms that obscure the action; fire/explosions
  filling the entire frame; lots of on-screen text; credits crawl. Avoid: blood, wounds, or realistic suffering;
  keep dragon simply unconscious.

ContinuityNotes: |
  Maintain early-era 3D animation look: slightly plasticky materials, gentle squash-and-stretch, readable
  staging. Keep Theo’s helmet noticeably too large whenever he is wearing it. Dragon is threatening but family-
  friendly; no gore, no injury detail. Action must stay readable: controlled fire, controlled lightning, no
  chaotic camera spins.
