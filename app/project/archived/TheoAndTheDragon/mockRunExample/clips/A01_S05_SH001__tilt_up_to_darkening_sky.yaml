Prompt: |
  Medium shot on Theo in 16:9, then a slow tilt upward into the sky: clouds thicken into dramatic gray, and a
  broad shadow passes over the neighborhood. A distant rumble builds like far-off thunder, and Theo’s helmeted
  head follows the movement with a small, tense swallow and widened stance. The camera movement is smooth and
  restrained, keeping the moment clear and anticipatory. The score holds a sustained note that feels like a
  question right before the villain appears.

Negative: |
  photorealistic live-action look; modern ultra-detailed CGI; hyper-real skin pores; realistic hair strand
  simulation; gritty realistic violence; blood; gore; injury detail; horror tone; harsh contrast teal-orange
  grading; excessive lens flare; extreme depth-of-field blur; unstable character identity; inconsistent
  clothing; duplicate Theo; extra parents; extra dragons; crowded streets full of people; modern brand logos;
  readable signage; subtitles; watermarks; UI overlays; glitch artifacts; warped faces; broken anatomy; extra
  limbs/fingers; melting objects; jittery teleporting motion; chaotic fast camera spins; aggressive handheld
  shake; extreme motion blur; strobing lights; noisy particle storms that obscure the action; fire/explosions
  filling the entire frame; lots of on-screen text; credits crawl. Avoid: chaotic cloud motion; avoid camera
  whip; keep tilt slow and clean.
