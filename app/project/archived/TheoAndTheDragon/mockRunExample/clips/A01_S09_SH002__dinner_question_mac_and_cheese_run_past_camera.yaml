Prompt: |
  Same fixed 16:9 angle: Theo pauses, tilts his head toward the other room, and calls loudly, “What’s for
  dinner, Mom?” From offscreen, Jordie answers clearly, “macaroni and cheese,” and Theo’s face immediately
  blooms into a huge grin. He suddenly sprints past the camera, quick footsteps and happy breathy laughter
  filling the audio as he rushes for his favorite meal. The camera stays still on the entryway and the neatly
  placed armor, emphasizing the calm after the adventure.

Negative: |
  photorealistic live-action look; modern ultra-detailed CGI; hyper-real skin pores; realistic hair strand
  simulation; gritty realistic violence; blood; gore; injury detail; horror tone; harsh contrast teal-orange
  grading; excessive lens flare; extreme depth-of-field blur; unstable character identity; inconsistent
  clothing; duplicate Theo; extra parents; extra dragons; crowded streets full of people; modern brand logos;
  readable signage; subtitles; watermarks; UI overlays; glitch artifacts; warped faces; broken anatomy; extra
  limbs/fingers; melting objects; jittery teleporting motion; chaotic fast camera spins; aggressive handheld
  shake; extreme motion blur; strobing lights; noisy particle storms that obscure the action; fire/explosions
  filling the entire frame; lots of on-screen text; credits crawl. Avoid: showing Jordie on camera if you can’t
  maintain continuity; keep her voice offscreen; avoid adding text captions.

ContinuityNotes: |
  Maintain early-era 3D animation look: slightly plasticky materials, gentle squash-and-stretch, readable
  staging. Keep Theo’s helmet noticeably too large whenever he is wearing it. Camera should feel like a classic
  fixed-position animated short; keep the armor pile clearly visible.
