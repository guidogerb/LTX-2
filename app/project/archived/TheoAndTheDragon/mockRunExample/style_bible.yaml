  Format:
    AspectRatio: "16:9"
    FrameRate: "24fps (suggested)"
    ShotLengthRule: "Each shot targets 6–10 seconds; never exceed 10 seconds."
    OverallAesthetic: |
      Early-era 3D animated short / early 2000s family-friendly CG vibe: clean shapes, simple shaders,
      slightly plasticky materials, gentle film grain, and classic comedic timing.

  CoreLook:
    Rendering:
      TextureDetail: "Low-to-medium detail; avoid photoreal micro-textures."
      Materials: "Toy-like plastics, soft specular highlights, simple diffuse shading."
      FilmGrain: "Subtle, consistent; never VHS-heavy."
      Color: |
        Warm and optimistic overall. Use bright suburbia colors, then cool the palette during storm beats,
        then return to warm daylight after victory.
    CharacterDesign:
      Proportions: "Slightly stylized; expressive faces without extreme realism."
      Consistency: "Theo helmet must remain too large; dragon must remain family-friendly; birds remain cute."

  AnimationPrinciples:
    MotionStyle: |
      Squash-and-stretch, clear anticipation, smooth ease-in/ease-out, readable arcs.
      Comedy comes from timing and physical exaggeration, not from chaotic motion.
    Staging:
      Rule: "Keep one primary action per shot; avoid too many moving elements at once."
      ActionReadability: "No rapid camera spins; avoid heavy motion blur; keep silhouettes clean."

  CameraLanguage:
    General:
      Stability: "Mostly stable camera; gentle dolly/track/tilt only when motivated."
      Handheld: "Only a tiny hint during battle urgency, never shaky or chaotic."
      Composition: "Clear hero-villain staging; keep both in frame for choreography beats."
    EndCap:
      FixedCamera: |
        The final home shots and end title use a fixed position camera, classic animated-short style,
        holding on the entryway and armor pile.

  LightingPlan:
    HomeInterior:

    SuburbiaDay:

    StormAndDragon:
      Mood: "Threatening but not horror."
      Light: "Cool overcast with warm fire flicker; occasional lightning flicker but not strobing."
    PostVictory:
      Mood: "Relief, warmth, restoration."
      Light: "Clouds part, sunbeams return; avoid blinding god-rays."

  VFXGuidelines:
    FireBreath:
      Style: "Cartoon-readable flame, controlled size and duration."
      Avoid: "Full-frame flames, thick smoke that hides characters."
    VortexBanishment:
      Style: "Clean spiral energy, readable motion, lightning flicker in rhythm."
      Avoid: "Chaotic particle storms, fast strobe lightning, jittering geometry."

  AudioBible:
    Music:
      Intro: "Short orchestral jingle synced to lamp hops."
      Home: "Soft cozy motif."
      Quest/Storm: "Playful-to-tense build, then orchestral action."
      Victory: "Warm triumphant resolution."
      End: "Gentle final chord + tiny stinger."
    SFX:
      TheoProps: "Plastic clacks, toy taps, light foot scuffs."
      Dragon: "Deep roars and rumbles (no horror screams)."
      Magic: "Electric hum swirl + punchy stomp impact."
