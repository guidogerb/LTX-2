Project: "Theo vs. The Dragon (Retro CG Short)"
LocationGuide:
  GeneralNotes: |
    Locations should feel like early-era CG sets: clean geometry, readable layout, slightly simplified textures,
    and warm family-friendly lighting. Avoid modern signage, brand logos, and clutter that blocks key action.

Locations:
  Neutral_Stage:
    Type: "Abstract intro stage"
    Description: |
      A clean, neutral, studio-like stage used only for the lamp intro. Smooth floor and backdrop, subtle
      film grain, simple lighting with soft shadows. No text, logos, or props.
    Lighting: "Soft key light and gentle fill; warm lamp beam used for the wipe transition."
    PromptAnchor: "clean neutral stage, simple backdrop, soft shadows, early-era 3D animation"

  Home_LivingRoom:
    Type: "Interior"
    Description: |
      Cozy suburban family room with a visible window casting warm morning light. Simple furnishings:
      couch, side table, a small workstation for Alex, and space for Theo to stand heroically.
      Jordie can be seen moving through chores with household items (laundry basket, towel, etc.).
    Lighting: "Warm morning sunlight + soft interior fill; stable and consistent across shots."
    Sound: "Soft room tone, faint household clinks, gentle morning ambience."
    PromptAnchor: "cozy suburban living room, warm morning light, early-era CG, simple furniture"

  Home_Entryway:
    Type: "Interior (fixed camera end location)"
    Description: |
      The inside view of the front door and a small entry area where Theo removes his armor.
      This area must remain uncluttered so the helmet and armor pile are clearly visible.
      Used for the final comedic dinner beat and the closing end-card shot.
    Lighting: "Warm indoor light, calm and steady."
    Camera: "Fixed position, classic animated-short feel."
    PromptAnchor: "fixed camera entryway, front door interior, warm light, armor pile visible"

  Suburbia_Street_Day:
    Type: "Exterior"
    Description: |
      A well-kept suburban neighborhood street: clean sidewalks, trimmed lawns, simple mailboxes,
      tidy houses, and a bright pleasant daytime sky. Minimal pedestrians and vehicles (prefer none).
    Lighting: "Bright daytime sun, soft shadows."
    Sound: "Birds chirping, light breeze, distant neighborhood quiet."
    PromptAnchor: "well-kept suburbia street, bright daytime, tidy lawns, early-era CG"

  Suburbia_Street_Day_to_Overcast:
    Type: "Exterior (transition mood)"
    Description: |
      Same street as Suburbia_Street_Day, but the sky gradually shifts as clouds gather.
      The light cools and dims in a gradual, readable way.
    Lighting: "Daylight cooling into overcast; no sudden jump to night."
    PromptAnchor: "suburban street, clouds gathering, gradual dimming, readable mood shift"

  Suburbia_Street_Storm:
    Type: "Exterior (combat stage)"
    Description: |
      The same street now under dramatic gray storm clouds. The dragon descends overhead, but the
      staging must remain readable: open street space, no crowds, minimal debris.
      Fire and lightning effects should be stylized and controlled (not full-frame chaos).
    Lighting: "Overcast storm light with occasional warm flicker from dragon fire."
    Sound: "Low thunder rumble, wind, dragon roars, orchestral action score."
    PromptAnchor: "stormy suburbia street, dramatic clouds, controlled lightning, stylized fire"

  Suburbia_Street_Storm_to_Clear:
    Type: "Exterior (banishment resolution)"
    Description: |
      The vortex and lightning lift the dragon upward, then the storm collapses and clears quickly.
      Keep the transformation smooth: dark clouds settle, then brighten back to normal daylight.
    Lighting: "Storm -> bright sunbeams; avoid strobe effects."
    PromptAnchor: "vortex in sky, lightning flicker, clouds clearing, sun returning"

  Suburbia_Street_Clear:
    Type: "Exterior (peace restored)"
    Description: |
      The street is restored to its calm, bright state. Theo is lit by soft sunbeams and the three blue
      birds can safely circle him. Keep colors cheerful and warm.
    Lighting: "Bright daylight, gentle sunbeams, soft shadows."
    Sound: "Birdsong returns, light breeze, warm triumphant music."
    PromptAnchor: "sunny suburbia restored, bright colors, calm ambience"
