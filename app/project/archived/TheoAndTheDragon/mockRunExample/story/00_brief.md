# Project Brief — Theo vs. the “Bad Dragon” (Retro Animated Short)

## One-line premise (logline)
A fearless little boy in oversized play armor marches out to “fight an evil dragon,” only to discover the dragon is real—so he defeats it in the most kid-like way possible: a scolding stomp that banishes it in a magical vortex, and then he runs inside for macaroni and cheese.

## Intended vibe
- **Early-era computer animation short** energy: simple sets, clean staging, playful squash-and-stretch, toy-like materials, warm comedy, and a “studio-style” **generic bouncing desk lamp intro** (no brand, no logos).
- **Family-friendly** adventure with a comedic button at the end.

## Format and constraints
- **Aspect ratio:** 16:9 widescreen
- **Shot duration cap:** ≤ 10 seconds per shot (designed as modular clips)
- **Staging priority:** readable action, clear silhouettes, minimal crowding, no chaotic camera spins
- **On-screen text:** keep minimal (only a simple “The End” if it renders cleanly)

## Target runtime
~2:00–3:00 total depending on pacing, transitions, and hold times.

## Main characters
- **Theo (protagonist):** young boy, play armor, oversized helmet, plastic sword and shield; brave posture, bright eyes, kid logic.
- **Dragon (villain):** large, fire-breathing, intimidating but still “cartoon-readable,” no gore/horror.
- **Jordie (mom):** warm, busy with housework; supportive smile.
- **Alex (dad):** working on computer; amused, supportive.

## Locations
- **Family home interior:** warm morning light, cozy entryway and living area.
- **Suburban street:** well-kept lawns, tidy houses, clear sky that darkens for the dragon event.

## Story instruments / metrics
- **Protagonist goal:** protect the neighborhood and prove his “knight” identity.
- **Villain goal:** menace and burn the neighborhood (visible threat via fire + storm).
- **Rising tension:** peaceful suburbia → clouds gather → dragon descends.
- **Climax:** Theo wins, chooses not to “slay,” instead scolds (“BAD DRAGON!”) and stomps → vortex banishment.
- **Resolution:** sun returns, birds thank him, he goes home to dinner.

## Key comedic motifs
- Theo’s **helmet is slightly too large** throughout (visual punchline).
- Heroic action resolved with a **kid scold + stomp**, not lethal violence.
- Epic adventure ends with **macaroni and cheese** as the ultimate reward.
