# A02_S02 — Finalle (Bird Thanks → Dinner → The End)

**EXT. SUBURBAN STREET — DAY**

The neighborhood is restored: bright, peaceful, sunlit.

THEO stands up, smiling wide, and straightens his play armor with proud little pats. His helmet is still noticeably too large and a bit crooked.

Three blue birds flutter into view, circling him playfully.

One bird lands on the tip of Theo’s sword.

### BLUE BIRD (high-pitched, birdlike)
“Thanks Theo! You saved us all!”

The bird rejoins its friends. Theo smiles and walks home.

**INT. FAMILY HOME — DAY (FIXED CAMERA)**

From a fixed camera near the front door, Theo enters and shuts the door.

He removes his helmet and armor and places them down neatly in view.

Theo pauses and calls toward another room.

### THEO
“What’s for dinner, Mom?”

### JORDIE (O.S.)
“macaroni and cheese.”

Theo’s face lights up. He runs past the fixed camera, excited footsteps fading.

The camera holds on the quiet entryway and Theo’s discarded armor.

**“The End”** fades in, then fades to black.
