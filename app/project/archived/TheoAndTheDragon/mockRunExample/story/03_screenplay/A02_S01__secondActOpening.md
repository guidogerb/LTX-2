# A02_S01 — Dragon Attack and Battle

**EXT. SUBURBAN STREET — CONTINUOUS**

The clouds deepen into dramatic gray.

A massive DRAGON breaks through the sky, wings beating with heavy weight. It roars.

A bright stream of fire bursts from its mouth, lighting rooftops in a warm flicker.

THEO snaps into a brave stance: shield up, sword forward, feet planted wide.

He charges with a high-pitched battle yell.

## The Fight (Clear, readable beats)
The dragon blasts flame—Theo blocks behind his plastic shield, sliding back a little on the pavement.

The dragon swipes a claw—cracking the street in chunky stylized pieces. Theo dodges, helmet bobbling, then counters with quick determined taps.

The dragon lunges—Theo rolls across the street and pops back up, adjusting his slipping helmet with stubborn courage.

Theo finds his opening and jabs upward beneath the dragon’s jawline. The dragon staggers, wings flaring.

Theo pushes forward with everything he has. The dragon’s roar breaks into a surprised grunt.

The DRAGON collapses unconscious onto the street with a heavy thud and a dust puff.

## Victory Twist
Theo climbs onto the dragon’s mighty head and lifts his sword high, smiling in triumph.

He does NOT strike.

### THEO
“BAD DRAGON!”

Theo lifts one foot and stomps the dragon’s head.

A mysterious energy burst erupts at the point of impact—swirling into a bright electrified vortex.

Theo jumps off and tumbles safely away as the vortex coils around the dragon.

Lightning flickers. The dragon spins upward, swallowed by the vortex, and disappears into the clouds.

A thunder-crack. Sudden calm.

The storm clears rapidly. Sunlight returns.
