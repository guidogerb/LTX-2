# A01_S02 — The Street (Peaceful Suburbia Turns Ominous)

**EXT. SUBURBAN STREET — DAY**

A wide, well-kept neighborhood: bright lawns, tidy sidewalks, friendly houses.

THEO marches down the street with determined little steps, plastic sword forward, shield up. His oversized helmet wobbles and dips low, so he keeps tilting his head to see.

The ambience is peaceful—birds, distant breeze.

Slowly, the sky shifts. Clouds gather. The light cools and dims.

Theo’s posture tightens; he raises the shield slightly higher, as if sensing danger.

A low rumble rolls through the air. A shadow passes across the clouds.

Theo looks up—small in the wide street—ready for whatever comes next.
