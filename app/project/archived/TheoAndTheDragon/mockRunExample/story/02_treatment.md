# Treatment — Theo vs. the “Bad Dragon”

A clean, neutral stage appears in a **retro, early-era 3D animation** look—simple materials, soft film grain, and playful squash-and-stretch. A **generic white desk lamp** bounces into view, full of personality in the tilt of its shade and the spring of its neck. It clicks on, and its warm beam blooms into a bright wipe that becomes morning sunlight inside a cozy suburban home.

In the living area, **Theo**—a small boy dressed as a knight—stands proudly in **play armor** with a **helmet that’s slightly too large**, slipping low enough that he has to tilt his head to see. He grips a plastic sword and shield like they’re legendary weapons. With total conviction, he announces to his parents, **Jordie** and **Alex**, “Mom, Dad, I am going outside to fight the evil dragon that is destroying the neighborhood.” Jordie is mid-housework; Alex is at a computer. They exchange a quick, amused glance that says they adore this phase of his life. Smiling, they grant permission, and Theo marches out with the intensity of a heroic quest—while they gently return to their routines.

Outside, the neighborhood is **picture-perfect suburbia**: tidy lawns, bright colors, and quiet morning ambience. Theo shuffles down the street, his oversized helmet bobbing and blocking part of his vision, but his posture stays determined—shield raised, sword forward, “protector of the realm.” Then the mood shifts. The sky dims as **clouds gather**, and the friendly ambience thins as a low rumble grows in the distance.

Suddenly, a **massive fire-breathing dragon** descends through the darkening clouds. It roars and spews a bright, cartoon-readable stream of flame, turning the calm street into an arena. Theo doesn’t run. He charges—small but fearless—and the battle begins with clean, readable choreography: Theo blocks a blast with his shield, dodges a heavy claw swipe that cracks the pavement, and counters with quick determined taps and jabs. The dragon lunges; Theo rolls to safety and pops back up, adjusting his slipping helmet with stubborn courage.

In a final decisive exchange, Theo finds his moment and pushes through. The dragon staggers, loses its footing, and collapses unconscious into the street with a heavy thud and a stylized dust puff. Theo climbs onto the dragon’s mighty head, lifts his sword high, and freezes in a classic victorious pose—smiling as heroic music holds.

But Theo doesn’t strike. Instead, he scolds the villain with kid-logic justice: **“BAD DRAGON!”** He lifts a foot and stomps down. At the instant of impact, a **mysterious energy emission** erupts into a swirling vortex—bright, electric, and magical. Theo jumps off and tumbles away as the vortex coils around the dragon, lifting it into the air. Lightning flickers in rhythmic bolts as the dragon spirals upward, swallowed by the vortex and disappearing into the clouds.

The storm immediately resolves: the dark clouds soften and part, sunlight pours through, and the neighborhood’s colors snap back to peaceful normal. Sunbeams land on Theo as he stands and straightens his play armor with proud little pats. His helmet is still too big, still a little crooked—still Theo.

Three blue birds flutter into the scene, circling him playfully. One lands on the tip of Theo’s sword and chirps in a high, birdlike voice: **“Thanks Theo! You saved us all!”** Theo smiles, watching the bird rejoin its friends, and continues walking home as the music turns warm and satisfied.

Back inside, from a fixed camera near the front door, Theo enters, shuts the door, and removes his helmet and armor, placing them neatly in view. He pauses and calls out, **“What’s for dinner, Mom?”** From another room, Jordie answers, **“macaroni and cheese.”** Theo’s face lights up—an even bigger victory than the battle—and he dashes past the camera toward dinner. The camera stays fixed on the quiet entryway and Theo’s discarded armor as **“The End”** fades in and then to black, closing the short with a gentle, classic animated finish.
