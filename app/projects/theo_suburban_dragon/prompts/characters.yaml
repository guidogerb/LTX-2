characters:
  Theo:
    description: Theo is a 12-year-old boy with a mop of unruly brown hair that often
      falls into his bright, curious green eyes. He has a slight build, typical of
      a boy his age, but his posture is confident, hinting at a determination beyond
      his years. His skin is lightly tanned from spending afternoons playing outside,
      and his cheeks are often flushed with excitement or mischief. Theo usually wears
      comfortable, slightly worn clothes like faded jeans and a favorite red hoodie,
      which he believes brings him luck.
  The Dragon:
    description: The dragon is a fearsome creature, with scales that shimmer in hues
      of dark emerald and obsidian, giving it an almost ethereal glow in the moonlight.
      Its eyes are a piercing gold, filled with an ancient intelligence and a touch
      of malice. The dragon's wings are vast and leathery, casting ominous shadows
      when unfurled. Its claws are razor-sharp, and its teeth are like ivory daggers,
      capable of tearing through the toughest defenses. Despite its menacing appearance,
      there is a grace to its movements, suggesting a creature that is both powerful
      and cunning.
  Theo's Friends:
    description: Theo's friends are a diverse group, each bringing their unique strengths
      to the team. There's Mia, a tall, athletic girl with curly black hair and an
      infectious smile, known for her quick thinking and bravery. Sam is a tech-savvy
      boy with glasses perched on his nose, his short blond hair always neatly combed,
      and his backpack filled with gadgets and tools. Lastly, there's Lily, a petite
      girl with long, straight auburn hair and a love for books, whose knowledge of
      myths and legends proves invaluable. Together, they form a tight-knit group,
      united by their loyalty and shared sense of adventure.
