Prompt: |
  Early-era 3D computer animation in 16:9 widescreen with subtle film grain and slightly plasticky materials: a
  small generic white desk lamp hops into frame onto a clean neutral stage, squashing on landing and stretching
  as it rebounds. The camera holds a steady medium-wide framing while the lamp’s springy neck wobbles and it
  does two quick bounces, each landing making a soft rubber squeak. A friendly orchestral jingle plays in sync
  with the hops, bright and simple like a classic animated short. The lamp tilts its shade left and right as if
  making eye contact with the viewer, then settles into a proud, ready pose facing camera.

Negative: |
  photorealistic live-action look; modern ultra-detailed CGI; hyper-real skin pores; realistic hair strand
  simulation; gritty realistic violence; blood; gore; injury detail; horror tone; harsh contrast teal-orange
  grading; excessive lens flare; extreme depth-of-field blur; unstable character identity; inconsistent
  clothing; duplicate Theo; extra parents; extra dragons; crowded streets full of people; modern brand logos;
  readable signage; subtitles; watermarks; UI overlays; glitch artifacts; warped faces; broken anatomy; extra
  limbs/fingers; melting objects; jittery teleporting motion; chaotic fast camera spins; aggressive handheld
  shake; extreme motion blur; strobing lights; noisy particle storms that obscure the action; fire/explosions
  filling the entire frame; lots of on-screen text; credits crawl. Avoid: brand logos, recognizable studio
  marks, and any readable text on the stage.
