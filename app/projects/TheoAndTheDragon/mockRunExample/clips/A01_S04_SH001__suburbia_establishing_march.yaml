Prompt: |
  Wide establishing shot in 16:9: a well-kept suburban street with neat lawns, tidy houses, and bright morning
  colors rendered in simple early-era CG geometry. Theo appears small in frame, marching down the sidewalk with
  earnest hero energy, sword forward and shield up despite the toy-like look. The camera stays stable and wide
  to clearly establish the peaceful neighborhood and Theo’s tiny scale within it. Birds chirp and a light breeze
  rustles leaves under a gentle, optimistic musical phrase.

Negative: |
  photorealistic live-action look; modern ultra-detailed CGI; hyper-real skin pores; realistic hair strand
  simulation; gritty realistic violence; blood; gore; injury detail; horror tone; harsh contrast teal-orange
  grading; excessive lens flare; extreme depth-of-field blur; unstable character identity; inconsistent
  clothing; duplicate Theo; extra parents; extra dragons; crowded streets full of people; modern brand logos;
  readable signage; subtitles; watermarks; UI overlays; glitch artifacts; warped faces; broken anatomy; extra
  limbs/fingers; melting objects; jittery teleporting motion; chaotic fast camera spins; aggressive handheld
  shake; extreme motion blur; strobing lights; noisy particle storms that obscure the action; fire/explosions
  filling the entire frame; lots of on-screen text; credits crawl. Avoid: crowds of people; avoid modern signage
  and brand logos; keep street clean and minimal.
