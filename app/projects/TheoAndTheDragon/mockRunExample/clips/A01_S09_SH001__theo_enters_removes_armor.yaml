Prompt: |
  16:9 fixed camera near the front door inside the house, like a classic animated short: Theo enters, shuts the
  door, and exhales with satisfied relief. He removes his oversized helmet and sets it down, then slips off his
  play armor pieces one by one, placing them neatly in view with soft plastic clacks. The lighting is warm and
  domestic, and the adventurous score softens into a gentle ‘home safe’ motif. Offscreen household sounds—faint
  dishes and distant footsteps—bring the world back to ordinary.

Negative: |
  photorealistic live-action look; modern ultra-detailed CGI; hyper-real skin pores; realistic hair strand
  simulation; gritty realistic violence; blood; gore; injury detail; horror tone; harsh contrast teal-orange
  grading; excessive lens flare; extreme depth-of-field blur; unstable character identity; inconsistent
  clothing; duplicate Theo; extra parents; extra dragons; crowded streets full of people; modern brand logos;
  readable signage; subtitles; watermarks; UI overlays; glitch artifacts; warped faces; broken anatomy; extra
  limbs/fingers; melting objects; jittery teleporting motion; chaotic fast camera spins; aggressive handheld
  shake; extreme motion blur; strobing lights; noisy particle storms that obscure the action; fire/explosions
  filling the entire frame; lots of on-screen text; credits crawl. Avoid: camera movement here; keep it fixed;
  avoid clutter blocking the armor pile.

ContinuityNotes: |
  Maintain early-era 3D animation look: slightly plasticky materials, gentle squash-and-stretch, readable
  staging. Keep Theo’s helmet noticeably too large whenever he is wearing it. Camera should feel like a classic
  fixed-position animated short; keep the armor pile clearly visible.
