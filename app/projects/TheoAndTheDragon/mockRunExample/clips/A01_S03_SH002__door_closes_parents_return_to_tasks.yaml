Prompt: |
  From a fixed 16:9 interior angle looking toward the door, Theo steps outside and the door closes with a soft,
  satisfying click. Jordie resumes tidying with calm, efficient motions, and Alex refocuses on his computer,
  posture relaxed, both still amused by their son’s ‘quest.’ The camera remains steady and slightly wide,
  emphasizing ordinary home life returning. The orchestral theme gently pivots from cozy to adventurous as the
  soundscape transitions fully outdoors.

Negative: |
  photorealistic live-action look; modern ultra-detailed CGI; hyper-real skin pores; realistic hair strand
  simulation; gritty realistic violence; blood; gore; injury detail; horror tone; harsh contrast teal-orange
  grading; excessive lens flare; extreme depth-of-field blur; unstable character identity; inconsistent
  clothing; duplicate Theo; extra parents; extra dragons; crowded streets full of people; modern brand logos;
  readable signage; subtitles; watermarks; UI overlays; glitch artifacts; warped faces; broken anatomy; extra
  limbs/fingers; melting objects; jittery teleporting motion; chaotic fast camera spins; aggressive handheld
  shake; extreme motion blur; strobing lights; noisy particle storms that obscure the action; fire/explosions
  filling the entire frame; lots of on-screen text; credits crawl. Avoid: showing Theo again inside; avoid
  sudden lighting jumps; keep continuity of morning light.
