Prompt: |
  16:9 wide shot aimed upward: the vortex wraps around the dragon and lifts it into the dark sky, spinning it in
  a controlled spiral while lightning flickers rhythmically around the swirl. Theo finishes his roll on the
  pavement and looks up, one arm raised to block the brightness, his posture showing awe and relief. The dragon
  vanishes into the clouds with a sharp thunder-crack, and the violent energy collapses upward like it’s being
  zipped closed. The clouds quickly soften and settle back toward normal as the score drops into calm.

Negative: |
  photorealistic live-action look; modern ultra-detailed CGI; hyper-real skin pores; realistic hair strand
  simulation; gritty realistic violence; blood; gore; injury detail; horror tone; harsh contrast teal-orange
  grading; excessive lens flare; extreme depth-of-field blur; unstable character identity; inconsistent
  clothing; duplicate Theo; extra parents; extra dragons; crowded streets full of people; modern brand logos;
  readable signage; subtitles; watermarks; UI overlays; glitch artifacts; warped faces; broken anatomy; extra
  limbs/fingers; melting objects; jittery teleporting motion; chaotic fast camera spins; aggressive handheld
  shake; extreme motion blur; strobing lights; noisy particle storms that obscure the action; fire/explosions
  filling the entire frame; lots of on-screen text; credits crawl. Avoid: strobe-like lightning; avoid chaotic
  spinning that causes artifacts; keep the spiral smooth.

ContinuityNotes: |
  Maintain early-era 3D animation look: slightly plasticky materials, gentle squash-and-stretch, readable
  staging. Keep Theo’s helmet noticeably too large whenever he is wearing it. Dragon is threatening but family-
  friendly; no gore, no injury detail. Action must stay readable: controlled fire, controlled lightning, no
  chaotic camera spins.
