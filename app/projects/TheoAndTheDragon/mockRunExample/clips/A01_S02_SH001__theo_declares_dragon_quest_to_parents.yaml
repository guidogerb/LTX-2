Prompt: |
  Warm suburban home interior in early-era 3D animation, 16:9: Theo, an 8-year-old boy in shiny play armor with
  an oversized helmet sitting low on his brow, stands in a medium-wide shot gripping a plastic shield and sword.
  He plants his feet wide, puffs his chest, and raises his voice with bright excitement, saying, “Mom, Dad, I am
  going outside to fight the evil dragon that is destroying the neighborhood.” The camera eases in with a gentle
  dolly to emphasize his heroic seriousness, and the toy materials catch soft window highlights. A playful
  adventure motif begins under his line, while the room’s ambience stays cozy and domestic.

Negative: |
  photorealistic live-action look; modern ultra-detailed CGI; hyper-real skin pores; realistic hair strand
  simulation; gritty realistic violence; blood; gore; injury detail; horror tone; harsh contrast teal-orange
  grading; excessive lens flare; extreme depth-of-field blur; unstable character identity; inconsistent
  clothing; duplicate Theo; extra parents; extra dragons; crowded streets full of people; modern brand logos;
  readable signage; subtitles; watermarks; UI overlays; glitch artifacts; warped faces; broken anatomy; extra
  limbs/fingers; melting objects; jittery teleporting motion; chaotic fast camera spins; aggressive handheld
  shake; extreme motion blur; strobing lights; noisy particle storms that obscure the action; fire/explosions
  filling the entire frame; lots of on-screen text; credits crawl. Avoid: Theo changing age/face; avoid armor
  becoming real metal; keep helmet obviously too large.
