Prompt: |
  16:9 fixed shot holds on the quiet entryway where Theo left his helmet and play armor, now still and peaceful
  under warm indoor light. The room tone is soft, and the music resolves into a final gentle chord with a tiny
  playful flourish at the end. A simple centered end title fades in reading “The End,” large and minimal for
  clarity, then holds briefly. The image fades to black with subtle film grain lingering for a beat as the final
  orchestral stinger closes the short.

Negative: |
  photorealistic live-action look; modern ultra-detailed CGI; hyper-real skin pores; realistic hair strand
  simulation; gritty realistic violence; blood; gore; injury detail; horror tone; harsh contrast teal-orange
  grading; excessive lens flare; extreme depth-of-field blur; unstable character identity; inconsistent
  clothing; duplicate Theo; extra parents; extra dragons; crowded streets full of people; modern brand logos;
  readable signage; subtitles; watermarks; UI overlays; glitch artifacts; warped faces; broken anatomy; extra
  limbs/fingers; melting objects; jittery teleporting motion; chaotic fast camera spins; aggressive handheld
  shake; extreme motion blur; strobing lights; noisy particle storms that obscure the action; fire/explosions
  filling the entire frame; lots of on-screen text; credits crawl. Avoid: garbled or misspelled text; avoid long
  credits; keep “The End” simple, centered, and short.

ContinuityNotes: |
  Maintain early-era 3D animation look: slightly plasticky materials, gentle squash-and-stretch, readable
  staging. Keep Theo’s helmet noticeably too large whenever he is wearing it. Camera should feel like a classic
  fixed-position animated short; keep the armor pile clearly visible.
