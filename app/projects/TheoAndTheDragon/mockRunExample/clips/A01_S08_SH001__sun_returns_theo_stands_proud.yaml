Prompt: |
  16:9 medium-wide: clouds part and sunlight pours through, restoring the neighborhood’s bright colors and
  peaceful ambience. Theo lies on the ground for a beat, then sits up and stands, smiling wide as he straightens
  his play armor with proud little pats. His helmet is still noticeably too large and slightly crooked, keeping
  the comedy gentle and consistent. The camera dollies in subtly as the music resolves into a warm, triumphant
  theme.

Negative: |
  photorealistic live-action look; modern ultra-detailed CGI; hyper-real skin pores; realistic hair strand
  simulation; gritty realistic violence; blood; gore; injury detail; horror tone; harsh contrast teal-orange
  grading; excessive lens flare; extreme depth-of-field blur; unstable character identity; inconsistent
  clothing; duplicate Theo; extra parents; extra dragons; crowded streets full of people; modern brand logos;
  readable signage; subtitles; watermarks; UI overlays; glitch artifacts; warped faces; broken anatomy; extra
  limbs/fingers; melting objects; jittery teleporting motion; chaotic fast camera spins; aggressive handheld
  shake; extreme motion blur; strobing lights; noisy particle storms that obscure the action; fire/explosions
  filling the entire frame; lots of on-screen text; credits crawl. Avoid: sudden location change; keep street
  consistent; avoid overly dramatic god-rays that obscure Theo.
