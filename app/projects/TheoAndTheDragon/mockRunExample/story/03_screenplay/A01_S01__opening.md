# A01_S01 — Opening (Lamp Intro → Theo Declares the Quest)

**STYLE NOTE:** Early-era 3D animated short, 16:9, subtle film grain, toy-like plasticky materials, squash-and-stretch motion, clean readable staging.

## 1) Neutral Intro Stage (Animated Lamp)
A clean, neutral stage. A small, generic white desk lamp hops into frame with springy squash-and-stretch.

The lamp bounces twice, tilts its shade as if “looking” at the audience, then clicks on—its warm beam blooming into a bright wipe.

## 2) Family Home Interior (Morning)
The bright wipe becomes sunlight through a window. We are in a cozy suburban home.

THEO stands in play armor with an oversized helmet that dips low on his brow. He grips a plastic sword and shield like they’re legendary.

### THEO
“Mom, Dad, I am going outside to fight the evil dragon that is destroying the neighborhood.”

JORDIE is busy with housework. ALEX works at a computer. They both smile.

They glance at each other and laugh softly—affectionate, amused, proud.

Jordie nods permission. Alex nods too.

Theo beams, turns, and shuffles toward the front door—helmet wobbling, blocking part of his view—yet his posture is heroic.

He exits into bright daylight. The door closes behind him.
