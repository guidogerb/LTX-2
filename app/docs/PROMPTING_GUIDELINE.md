The guide explains how to write detailed, cinematic prompts for LTX-2 that describe the whole shot—scene, characters, action, camera, and audio—so the model can generate coherent, emotionally clear video clips.[1]

## Core idea

LTX-2 works best when given a single, flowing paragraph that reads like a short shot description: present tense, 4–8 descriptive sentences, covering what the viewer sees, hears, and how the camera moves from start to finish. Matching detail to shot scale (more detail for closeups, less for wide shots) and iterating on prompts is encouraged as part of the workflow.[1]

## Key elements of a strong prompt

- **Establish the shot:** Use cinematic terms (e.g., wide establishing shot, close-up) and genre cues (film noir, fantasy, documentary) to set framing and style.[1]
- Set the scene: Describe lighting, color palette, textures, and atmosphere (fog, rain, dust) to define mood and environment.[1]
- Describe the action: Write the action as a natural sequence that flows from beginning to end, rather than disjointed instructions.[1]
- Define characters: Specify age, appearance, clothing, and visible emotional cues through posture and facial expression.[1]
- Camera movement: Explicitly state pans, dollies, zooms, and how subjects appear after the motion to keep motion readable.[1]
- Audio and dialogue: Indicate ambience, music, and speech; put dialogue in quotes and specify language or accent when needed.[1]

## Helpful vocab and styles

The guide suggests using category and style labels early in the prompt, such as animation styles (2D/3D, stop-motion, claymation), stylized looks (comic book, cyberpunk, painterly), or cinematic genres (period drama, thriller, space opera, documentary). It also lists visual details (lighting, texture, color, atmosphere), sound and voice descriptors (whisper, shout, announcer, robotic), and technical markers (handheld, over-the-shoulder, slow motion, film grain, depth of field) to better control the **look** and feel.[1]

## What LTX-2 handles well

- Cinematic compositions with clear shot types, natural motion, and thoughtful lighting and depth of field.[1]
- Emotive human moments focusing on a single subject’s expressions and subtle gestures.[1]
- Strong atmosphere and setting with weather, reflections, and ambient textures that ground the scene.[1]
- Clean camera language like “slow dolly in,” “handheld tracking,” “over-the-shoulder.”[1]
- Stylized aesthetics (painterly, noir, analog film, fashion editorial, pixelated animation, surreal art) and careful lighting and color to control mood.[1]
- Spoken and sung **voice** in multiple languages.[1]

## Common pitfalls to avoid

- Relying on internal state words (sad, confused) instead of visible cues like slumped shoulders or trembling hands.[1]
- Expecting good text or logos in the frame; LTX-2 is weak at readable, consistent text and branded signage.[1]
- Overly complex physics or chaotic motion (fast twisting, juggling) that produce artifacts, and scenes overloaded with many characters and actions.[1]
- Inconsistent lighting logic (e.g., conflicting light sources) and overstuffed prompts with too many instructions, which reduces clarity. Starting simpler and iterating is recommended.[1]
